# **Pochi User Manual**

Welcome to the Pochi documentation - your comprehensive guide to using your Full-Stack AI Teammate. Here you'll find resources to help you get started, maximize productivity, and build amazing applications with the state-of-the-art AI capabilities.

## **What is Pochi?**

Pochi is your **Full-Stack AI Teammate** - an AI-powered development assistant that integrates deeply into your native workflow. Unlike generic AI tools, Pochi functions like a real engineer teammate who understands your context, evolves with your projects, contributes code, components, and tools directly, and manage them efficiently across your native development environment.

**What makes Pochi distinctive** is its comprehensive approach to software development. Rather than simply generating code snippets, Pochi collaborates with developers by understanding entire project contexts, handling visual-first prompts, and maintaining long-term memory of your codebase and preferences. It can build complete applications, generate UI components from screenshots, create games, and provide in-IDE assistanceâ€”all through natural language commands.

Pochi is built by the TabbyML team but operates as a standalone product, designed specifically for developers who want an AI teammate that grows smarter with every interaction.
