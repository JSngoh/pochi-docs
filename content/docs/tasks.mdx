# **Tasks**

Tasks represent discrete development objectives Pochi manages from conception to completion. Each task maintains its own context, progress tracking, and collaboration thread within your team's workspace.

Tasks differ from simple prompts by maintaining persistent context, enabling collaborative development, and chain of conversations.

## **Start a Task**

**Task Thread Features:**

**Automatic Planning**: Pochi analyzes your request and creates a structured development plan in the thread

**Progress Updates**: Regular status messages showing completed work and next steps

**Code Sharing**: Generated files and components posted directly for team review

**Collaborative Input**: Team members can suggest changes or provide additional requirements

**Approval Workflow**: Request review from team leads before implementation or deployment

## **Interruption (Rejection, Editing)**

You can interrupt Pochi at any time to modify requirements, reject approaches, adjust priorities, or incorporate team feedback.

**How it works**: Changes are immediately reflected in the task thread with updated plans. All thread participants are notified of modifications, while previous work remains accessible in the thread history. Development resumes seamlessly with new requirements while maintaining consistency.
