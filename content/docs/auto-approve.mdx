# **Auto Approve**

Auto-approve allows Pochi to execute certain actions autonomously without requiring manual confirmation for each step, streamlining your development workflow.

## **How it works**

By default, Pochi will ask for your permission before taking any action, including reading or writing files.
If you want to allow Pochi to do something without asking, you can set the Auto Approve permission for that action.

## **Permission Options**

**Read Operations**

- **Source Code Analysis**: Examines files to understand structure and context
- **Configuration Files**: Reads package.json, tsconfig.json, and other config files
- **Documentation**: Analyzes README files and project documentation
- **Architecture Understanding**: Traverses directories to map project structure

**Write Operations**

- **File Creation**: Generates new files with complete implementations
- **Code Editing**: Makes targeted changes to existing files
- **Boilerplate Generation**: Creates templates and starter code
- **Configuration Updates**: Modifies config files as needed
- **Documentation**: Writes comments and documentation

**Execute Operations**

- **Dependency Management**: Runs npm install, pip install, etc.
- **Build Processes**: Executes npm run build and similar commands
- **Testing**: Runs test suites with npm test, pytest, etc.
- **Development Servers**: Starts dev servers with npm run dev
- **Version Control**: Performs git operations
- **System Operations**: Handles file management and system tasks

**Retry Logic**

- **Command Failures**: Analyzes errors and tries alternative solutions
- **Code Issues**: Reverts problematic changes and attempts different implementations
- **Dependency Problems**: Tries different package managers or versions when installations fail

## **Best Practices**

For most serious development workflows, we recommend starting with:

- Auto-approving read access to project files
- Setting a reasonable maximum request limit (10-20) [able to adjust?]

This gives Pochi enough freedom to explore your codebase without constant interruptions, while still requiring permission for edits or potentially destructive actions.

As you build more trust in Pochi's capabilities with your specific projects, you can gradually increase the permissions to match your comfort level.

Remember that you can always adjust these settings as your needs change - tighten permissions for critical production work, or loosen them when prototyping and exploring.
