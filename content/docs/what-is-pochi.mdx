# **What is Pochi?**

Pochi is your **Full-Stack AI Teammate** - an AI-powered development assistant that integrates deeply into your native workflow. Unlike generic AI tools, Pochi functions like a real engineer teammate who understands your context, evolves with your projects, contributes code, components, and tools directly, and manage them efficiently across your native development environment.

## **Key Benefits**

**What makes Pochi distinctive** is its comprehensive approach to software development. Rather than simply generating code snippets, Pochi collaborates with developers by understanding entire project contexts, handling visual-first prompts, and maintaining long-term memory of your codebase and preferences.

### **Core Capabilities**

- **Context-Aware Development**: Understands your entire project structure and coding patterns
- **Visual-First Approach**: Can work with screenshots and visual designs
- **Long-Term Memory**: Remembers your preferences and project history
- **Native Integration**: Works seamlessly within your existing development environment

## **Built by TabbyML**

Pochi is built by the TabbyML team but operates as a standalone product, designed specifically for developers who want an AI teammate that grows smarter with every interaction.

It can build complete applications, generate UI components from screenshots, create games, and provide in-IDE assistanceâ€”all through natural language commands.
