# **TODO List**

Pochi automatically creates and manages ***TODO lists*** to help you track progress on complex tasks.

You can think of it as a shared workspace between you and Pochi. Pochi will clearly show you the step-by-step progress it plans to deliver your tasks, and the real-time progress it's making.



## **Edits**

If you want to propose alternative TODO ordering, or maybe you've actually just finished one of the TODOs Pochi is planning for himself, you can simply modify the TODO list by marking them as
***completed***, or simply ***cancel*** some of them.
