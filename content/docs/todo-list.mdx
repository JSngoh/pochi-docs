# **TODO List**

Pochi automatically creates and manages ***TODO lists*** to help you track progress on complex tasks.

You can think of it as a shared workspace between you and Pochi. Pochi will clearly show you the step-by-step progress it plans to deliver your tasks, and the real-time progress it's making.


## **Interruptions**

Beyond that, just like you how work with real engineers, you can also interrupt Pochi's execution any time when you change your mind, or finds something wrong with Pochi's planning. Interruptions
come naturally just like how you'd talk with a fellow engineer - simply send a message to indicate your intension, then Pochi would pause and reconsiders task planning based on your message. Some 
interruption messages could look like 


```js
"Change the database from SQLite to PostgreSQL";
"This layout won't work on mobile. Use a card-based design instead";
"Don't use inline styles - let's go with CSS modules";
"Skip the styling for now - let's focus on the API integration first";
```

## **Edits**

If you want to propose alternative TODO ordering, or maybe you've actually just finished one of the TODOs Pochi is planning for himself, you can simply modify the TODO list by marking them as
***completed***, or simply ***cancel*** some of them.
