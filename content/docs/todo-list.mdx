# **TODO List**

The TODO List provides transparent, step-by-step execution of development tasks, showing exactly what Pochi plans to do and allowing real-time modifications.

## **What is TODO List / Step-by-Step Execution**

TODO Lists break down your development requests into specific, actionable steps that Pochi executes in sequence, providing complete visibility into the development process.

**How TODO Lists Work**

When you describe a complex task, Pochi creates a comprehensive TODO list covering:

- Project setup and file structure
- Component or feature development steps
- Styling and responsive design implementation
- Testing and validation requirements
- Documentation and deployment preparation

**Example TODO Breakdown:**

```text
Request: "Build a blog system with admin panel"

Generated TODO List:
□ 1. Set up project structure and dependencies
□ 2. Create database schema for posts and users
□ 3. Build authentication middleware and user management
□ 4. Implement blog post CRUD operations
□ 5. Create admin interface for content management
□ 6. Design responsive frontend for blog display
□ 7. Add comment system with moderation
□ 8. Set up deployment configuration
```

**Real-Time Progress**: As Pochi works through the list:

- Completed items are marked with ✅
- Current work is highlighted
- Remaining steps provide clear visibility into upcoming work
- Estimated time for completion is updated

## **TODO List Interruption and Management**

**Interruption (Rejection, Editing)**

Pochi's collaborative approach allows you to interrupt, redirect, or refine work at any stage while preserving context and progress.

**Types of Interruptions:**

**Scope Changes**: Modify requirements mid-development

```js
"Stop - add a dark mode toggle to this component before continuing";
"Change the database from SQLite to PostgreSQL";
```

**Approach Rejection**: Request a different implementation strategy

```js
"This layout won't work on mobile. Use a card-based design instead";
"Don't use inline styles - let's go with CSS modules";
```

**Priority Shifts**: Reorder TODO execution

```js
"Skip the styling for now - let's focus on the API integration first";
"Move the testing TODO to happen after each component is built";
```

**Requirement Additions**: Expand the TODO scope

```js
"Also add user role permissions to this auth system";
"Include email notifications for form submissions";
```

**Pochi's Context Preservation During Interruptions:**

**Work History**: Completed TODO items remain intact and available for reference

**Project Structure**: File organization and naming patterns are maintained

**Code Patterns**: Established coding style and architecture decisions persist

**Dependencies**: Package installations and configurations are preserved

**Seamless Recovery**: When resuming work after interruption:

- Pochi incorporates your feedback into the updated approach
- TODO list automatically reflects new requirements
- Progress continues from the logical checkpoint
- Consistency with completed work is maintained
