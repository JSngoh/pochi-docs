# **Tools & Integrations**

Pochi utilizes a set of built-in tools to expand its coding and task automation capabilities. To see a detailed explanation of what each tool does,
you can visit the settings page within the Pochi VSCode extension.

## **Available Integrations**

### GitHub

You can grant Pochi access to your GitHub repositories, which allows it to understand the full context of your code. 
This enables Pochi to assist with tasks including creating pull requests, reviewing code, tracking issues, branch management, resolving merge conflicts, and many other possibility for you to explore.


### Slack

Our Slack integration is currently in early experimentation. We envision Pochi being natively embedded wherever you and your team already collaborate. With the Slack integration, 
you can start development tasks directly from your Slack channels, receive real-time progress updates in conversation threads, and collaborate with Pochi easily.
