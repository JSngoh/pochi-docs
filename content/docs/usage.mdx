## **Pricing and Billing**

We use **Stripe** to handle all our billing and payment processing securely. 

Upon signing up Pochi, users would receive **$20 free usage credits** each month (renews monthly). Your usage is calculated based on the token cost of the LLMs you use, and we pass these costs 
directly through to you. We bill you automatically if your outstanding balance exceeds **$10**; otherwise, you are billed for any amount owed at the end of your 
monthly cycle. To help you manage your costs, you can also set a monthly spending budget on your `/profile` page.
