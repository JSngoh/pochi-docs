</div>

## **Pricing and Billing**

We use **Stripe** to handle all our billing and payment processing securely.

Pochi adopts a usage-based billing model. Your usage is calculated based on the token cost of the LLMs you use, and these costs will be passed directly on
to you. More details about pricing will be provided as we approach public launch, at which time more billing features will also be released.
